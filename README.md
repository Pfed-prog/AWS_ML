# AWS_ML

Deployed Using Elastic Beanstalk at http://app-env.eba-hxn3i6de.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

We are accessing Uniswap V3 GraphQL at https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v3?selected=playground to obtain historical data for the chosen token. he Default token is Uniswap.

Next we use model the time-series data to predict token price for the N number of timestamps. Default is 15 periods.

We have Used Arima(1,1,0) model since it has maths foundation and differences the data to make stationary.
